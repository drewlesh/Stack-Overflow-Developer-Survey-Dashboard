## 📁 Contents

Eight notebooks are included in this section:

### **1. `Histograms.ipynb`**

Covers how to visualize the distribution of numerical data using:

* Histograms
* Bin adjustments
* Reading distribution shapes (skewness, modality)

---

### **2. `Boxplots.ipynb`**

Shows how to use boxplots to:

* Identify medians, quartiles, and IQR
* Detect outliers visually
* Compare distributions across categories

---

### **3. `Scatterplots.ipynb`**

How to explore relationships between two variables using:

* Basic scatter plots
* Trend visualization
* Identifying clusters or patterns

---

### **4. `Bubbleplots.ipynb`**

Extends scatterplots by adding a third dimension using bubble size. Topics include:

* Encoding magnitude with size

* Visual clarity considerations

---

### **5. `Piecharts.ipynb`**

Explains how to represent categorical proportions using:

* Pie charts
* Interpreting relative percentages

---

### **6. `Stackedcharts.ipynb`**

Covers how to visualize part-to-whole relationships across categories using:

* Stacked bar charts
* Stacked area charts
* Understanding cumulative trends

---

### **7. `Linecharts.ipynb`**

Focuses on visualizing trends over time or ordered categories using:

* Line plots
* Multi-line comparisons
* Smoothing or highlighting patterns

---

### **8. `Barcharts.ipynb`**

Shows how to compare values across categories using:

* Vertical and horizontal bar charts
* Grouped and simple bar charts
* Highlighting top or bottom categories
